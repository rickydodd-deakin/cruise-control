## How To Run
To execute the complete system, simply run CruiseControlTester.py to run various tests on real inputs.

TestFuzz.py and TestDefuzz.py can both be ran independently to test the fuzzifier and defuzzifier, respectively.

FuzzySubsetVisualizations.ipynb can be ran independently to visualize the fuzzy subsets.

## Selected Intelligent Control System
Cruise control was selected.

## How To Contribute
### GitHub Desktop
The most friendly means of contributing (in the opinion of the current author of the README file) is GitHub Desktop.

After the installation process, which has it's own documentation which won't be repeated here, follow these steps to get a local version of the project files.

#### Step One, Press Code
If you've come this far, you should be able to see a green button with the word "Code." You're going to want to press that.

#### Step Two, Open with GitHub Desktop
Press "Open with GitHub Desktop."

At this point, you should have a local copy of the project files wherever you pathed where they'd go upon installing GitHub Desktop.

#### Step Three, Establishing Your Own Branch
A branch allows you to make alterations however you please with reassurance that, if things mess up, you can always pull back the main, which remains untouched until you merge with it!
To establish your own branch, simply press "Current branch" proceeded by "New branch," as depicted.

#### Step Four, Enter a Suitable Name and Create Branch
At this point, you just enter a suitable name, select the branch to base the branch on, and press "Create branch."

#### Step Five, Merging Your Branch With Main
When it feels like you've done everything necessary, and you want to merge your branch with the **main** branch, you simply switch to the **main** branch, press the "Current branch" button, and press "Choose a branch to merge into **branch-name**."

### What is .gitignore?
If you have anything you don't want committed to the repository, you can include that in this file.

### An Explanation of Colour
Edits you've made will show up similar to this. Green indicates something newly added, red indicates something deleted, and yellow indicates something modified.
